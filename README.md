# Spotify Music Trends Analysis Project

## Project Overview
The Spotify Music Trends Analysis Project aims to analyze and visualize music trends using data from the Spotify API. This project involves fetching data about tracks, artists, albums, and playlists, storing it in a relational database, processing and transforming the data using Python, and creating interactive visualizations to uncover insights about music trends.

## Features
- **API Integration**: Set up Spotify API access and fetched data for top artists and their popular songs.
- **Data Storage**: Designed and implemented a PostgreSQL database schema to efficiently store and manage large datasets.
- **Data Transformation**: Utilized Python and Pandas for data cleaning, manipulation, and transformation.
- **Data Visualization**: Created interactive visualizations using Plotly to uncover insights about music trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For scripting and data processing.
- **Spotify API**: For fetching music data.
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage and management.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and transformation.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations.
